backing up data, are less likely to experience cyber attacks and data breaches. The authors also note that, while basic cyber hygiene practices can be effective, they are not a silver bullet solution for cyber security. Sophisticated attackers can still find ways to bypass these controls, and organisations should not rely solely on basic cyber hygiene practices to protect themselves.

The article published by Lancaster University "Cyber Security Controls Effectiveness: A Qualitative Assessment of Cyber Essentials" discusses the effectiveness of the CE controls [17]. The authors conducted a qualitative assessment of CE by interviewing cyber security experts and practitioners from a range of industries. They asked the participants to rate the effectiveness of the CE controls in preventing various types of cyber attacks, such as phishing, malware, and insider threats. The study found that while the CE controls were generally effective at preventing common cyber threats, there were some limitations to their effectiveness. The authors also identified several factors that could impact the effectiveness of the CE controls, such as the size and complexity of an organisation's IT environment, the skill and expertise of its IT staff, and the level of employee awareness and training. Overall, the study suggests that organisations should view CE as a starting point for improving their cyber security and should continue to assess and improve their security posture over time.

The findings of [16] and [17] both point towards the need for AC in light of the changing threat landscape. For example [17], highlights the need for awareness and monitoring among others. We contribute to this existing body of work as:

* *In relation to prior studies, we find that CE controls are effective against a wide range of cyber attacks as has been reported in [16] & [17]. We find that patch management is not as prominent as a control in our study compared to prior evaluations [16]. Similar to prior evaluations we identify the need for AC. Some of the AC controls we propose are the same as [17] while we find the need for _back up_ and _encryption_ to mitigate some of the attack pathways in our corpus of incidents. In addition to the secure design defaults as noted by [17] we identify the need for secure deployment defaults to mitigate many attack pathways at their initial stages.
* *Compared to prior studies [16] & [17], we additionally focussed on ransomware attacks from our corpus of incidents. In these cases, CE controls by themselves can be applied to mitigate most of the attack pathways, however they need support of AC in many instances.
* *Beyond recommending AC, we raise an issue which is fairly foundational to the purpose of CE. Should controls only be preventive in nature or also pre-emptive? The former requires a complete understanding of all the possible threats well ahead of time. For business continuity it is important that systems respond to attacks as they happen or are imminent. To that end we suggest AC such as _back up_ that can pre-empt imminent or in progress attacks, for example, ransomware attacks.

## 3 Background

### Cyber Essentials Technical Controls

There are five technical controls organised under Cyber Essentials requirement for IT infrastructures1[5]:

Footnote 1: We use Version 3.0 as that was the current version at the time of the analysis.

* ***Firewall:** Firewalls mediate between traffic that leaves and enters a network through policies. The policies protect against unauthorised users getting inside a network and such policies can be specified in terms of source (who can access the network), destination (where users within the network can visit) and the type of services that are allowed in a network.
* ***Secure Configuration:** Systems come with a default configuration, for example, default admin user name and passwords which, if not changed, can allow attackers to exploit the system to harm the legitimate users.
* ***User Access Control:** Organisations should link the stable identity of their legitimate users to resources to prevent unauthorised access to the resources. The legitimate users would in turn prove their right to access such resources through something they know or they possess. This control mandates organisations should carefully onboard users, securely maintain their user list and remove users once they leave the organisation. This has implications on the security of other controls. Moreover, an organisation should also
