software [18]. Cryptocurrencies, along with an illicit market of exploits, facilitate ransomware as a service [9, 11] to low-skilled criminal gang.

Motivated by the previous study [17] and the changing threat landscape, we explore the extent to which CE controls remain robust as a basic cyber hygiene mechanism. We do so through a systematic analysis of 45 incident reports collected through a research agreement with a managed security services provider. These attacks are mapped to the MiTRE ATT&CK knowledge base and include a set of ransomware incidents. Our goal was to understand the extent to which CE controls could have prevented those breaches. The Research Questions (RQs) we address in this work as follows:

**RQ1.** Which attack pathways could have been inhibited by CE technical controls and, to what extent, i.e., whether these controls would completely inhibit those pathways or whether layering with other controls (multiple CE controls or a wider set) would have been required?

**RQ2.** Which controls beyond CE appear frequently as inhibitors of attacks and how effective are they in inhibiting particular attack pathways (on their own or in conjunction with other - including CE - controls)?

**RQ3.** Are there specific patterns of inhibition (whether CE controls or others) with regards to the subset of ransomware incidents in the corpus?

We used the Incident Fault Tree (IFT) approach [13, 7] to reconstruct the attacks in terms of events and mitigation mechanisms that could have prevented them. The method is an adaptation of the method used in our prior work on analysing data exfiltration attacks [13]. It enables systematic modelling of attacks and, critically, the points at which specific security controls provide suitable mitigations against particular attack pathways. In our model of the attacks, the mitigation mechanisms are expressed as _inhibit gates_. The presence or absence of _inhibit gates_ in comparison to the previous reports are analysed to understand the resilience of CE across space (i.e., the classes of attacks and types of attack pathways as modelled using MiTRE ATT&CK) and time (change in malware and attack behaviours since the initial research in those reports were conducted). For example, prior analysis shows an overwhelming majority of the breaches (131/200) were completely mitigated through Cyber Essential controls.

Our analysis shows that CE controls by themselves effectively mitigate most of the attack scenarios at the initial stages of the attack lifecycle. For instance, we find from our investigations of the ransomware incidents that CE controls can stop them at their initial stages. However, in some cases, as the attacks progress deeper into systems and networks, CE controls must be complemented with Additional Controls (AC). The pertinent question then is, whether we should consider incorporating AC controls as part of CE. This entails broadening the definition of controls to include recovery mechanisms such as back-ups. Finally, we synthesised our findings with the mapping of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) Cyber Advisor CE criterion to the Cyber Security Body of Knowledge (CyBOK) [12]. This mapping shows that the assessors are expected to have substantial knowledge of _cloud security_ and _applied cryptography_. This may be an indicator of the changing security needs over space and time. Expanding on the argument of broadening the scope of mitigation mechanisms, the AC we find as part of our investigations point towards the need for assessors to be conversant in additional knowledge areas like _Human Factors_ and _Security Operations and Incident Management_. Synthesising this mapping with the analysis from our IFTs and the cross-contrast with prior work enables us to build a fuller picture of the effectiveness of the current controls and also whether AC merit recommendation for inclusion.

We draw upon related work in Section 2 while discussing our contribution. In Section 3 we briefly discuss CE controls, the constituent elements and notations of IFT and MiTRE ATT&CK framework. This is followed by an overview of the dataset of the attacks in Section 4. Section 5 details the methods we use to analyse and arrive at the mitigation mechanisms. In Section 6, we outline the _edge_, _level_, _phase_ and _level+phase_ analysis we use on the dataset which is followed by our findings in Section 7. We discuss some of the key findings like AC, situation of the controls and compare with prior validation exercises in Section 8 which is followed by conclusion in Section 9.

Such et al. discuss the effectiveness of basic cyber hygiene practices in preventing cyber attacks [16]. The term "basic cyber hygiene" refers to a set of fundamental security practices recommended by many experts as a starting point for organisations to improve their cyber security posture. The paper reviews several studies and surveys that have examined the impact of basic cyber hygiene practices on cyber security outcomes. The studies suggest that organisations that implement basic cyber hygiene practices, such as keeping software up to date, using strong passwords, and regularly
