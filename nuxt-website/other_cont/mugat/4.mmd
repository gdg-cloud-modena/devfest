Procedures (TTP) of adversaries attacking Microsoft Windows systems which gradually expanded to a general record of adversarial behaviour on other platforms such as Linux, macOS, mobile devices and industrial control systems. This body of knowledge details pre & post compromise behaviour and is a useful tool for organisations to understand the potential vulnerable elements in their information and communication infrastructure.

At its core, ATT&CK is a behavioural model that consists of multiple core components:

* *Firstly, tactics refer to the short-term tactical goals adversaries aim to achieve during an attack.
* *Secondly, techniques describe the methods that adversaries use to achieve their tactical goals. These methods may include exploiting vulnerabilities, social engineering, or malicious software.
* *Thirdly, sub-techniques provide more specific details on the means by which adversaries achieve their tactical goals. These sub-techniques provide a more granular understanding of the techniques used by adversaries.
* *Finally, documented adversary usage of techniques, procedures, and other metadata provides context around how adversaries use specific tactics and techniques. This metadata helps security professionals to identify patterns in adversary behaviour and develop more effective defence strategies.

By incorporating these components into its framework, MiTRE ATT&CK enables security teams to gain a deeper understanding of how cyber adversaries operate. This understanding helps security professionals to develop proactive defence strategies that can identify and mitigate potential threats before they result in a security incident.

## 4 Dataset

The data was provided by an organisation that delivers managed security services. They provided us with incident reports from real breaches; hence we keep their and their clients' identities confidential. We received a total of 50 real-life incidents, out of which we were able to use 45 for modelling; the remaining five (5) were not usable due to lack of detail. As depicted in Figure 2, the majority of incidents were related to Phishing and Vulnerability Exploitation (VE). Phishing incidents were further categorised into Cobalt Strike & QakBot Malware Execution, Cryptominer, and Social Engineering Attacks. On the other hand, the VE category included Unpatched Software/Device Exploitation, Log4j Exploitation, ProxyShell Vulnerability Exploitation, SQL Injection & Brute Force, and Other CVEs Exploitation. Ransomware originated from both phishing and VE. The severity of the incidents varied and caused different impacts as shown in Figure 2, such as ransomware attacks caused data encryption, data exfiltration, unauthorised data deletion and data destruction. A different range of colours have been used to segregate the incidents that are associated with multiple impacts.

## 5 Method

Our research methodology involved a multi-stage process that included the independent modelling of IFTs by the primary researcher, followed by review and feedback from a second researcher, and a subsequent collaborative discussion resulting in updates to the IFT models.

During the first stage, the primary researcher worked independently to create an IFT model for each incident under investigation. The IFT model provides a graphical representation of the various events and factors that contributed to the incident, helping to identify its root causes and contributing factors.

In the second stage, the IFT models were handed over to the second researcher for review. The second researcher carefully reviewed the IFT models to identify any discrepancies or omissions and suggested necessary improvements (i.e., arguing to consensus [8]). In case of disagreements, they were referred to a third researcher to resolve them through discussion and brainstorming. This process ensured that the IFT models were as comprehensive and accurate as possible.
