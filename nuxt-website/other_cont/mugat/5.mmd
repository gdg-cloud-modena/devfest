### IFT Modelling

The IFT modelling usually began by first reading the incident reports. The incident data were mapped to MiTRE ATT&CK TTPs. These reports include a timeline, executive summary, and remediation actions for each incident. We first started reading the executive summary to identify the type of incident and its impacts. The report began with initial access, which was usually the first stage in ATT&CK. From there, the report detailed the steps taken by the attacker to carry out their attack.

Based on the information in the incident report, the first intermediate event was identified, which usually involved a network intrusion. This was followed by network infection and a third intermediate event based on the impact of the attack. The report was then studied in detail to identify each of the leaf nodes, which are the basic events that lead to the top intermediate events.

We have shown one of the IFT models from the dataset in Figure 3. The incident is about the Black Basata ransomware attack that resulted in data exfiltration and server shutdown in an organisation. IFTs help identify the confluence of sub-trees that facilitate an attack. In this case _network intrusion_, _network infection_ and _data encryption & server shutdown_ sub-trees contribute to the success of the attack. In our diagram we denote them as 1, 2 and 3 respectively. If we drill down into each of them we identify the _basic events_, _intermediate events_ and _inhibit gates_ that form the individual sub-trees. They are numbered accordingly; for example, an _intermediate event_ for 1 will be numbered as 1.x, so on and so forth for each of the other sub-trees.

For _network intrusion_, the attacker exploited legitimate Windows command line utility and the ability to execute services on a remote host. We classify them as _basic events_ as they are the core enablers and form the leaf nodes for _network intrusion_. The inhibit gate identifies the mitigation for the leaf nodes in _network intrusion_, which is a secure configuration. The absence of secure configuration allows the execution of Qakbot PowerShell payload and Cobalt Strike beacon as 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 of Figure 3. While the IFT reconstructs the path, it also identifies the intersection where mitigation could have helped and, in turn, the Cyber Essential control and/or AC. The separation between the enabler and the consequent action enables a nuanced understanding of incidents and corresponding mitigations. The other
