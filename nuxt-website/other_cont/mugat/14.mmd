(m3), can be used in parallel (m1 \(\parallel\) m2 \(\parallel\) m3) for attack mitigation. If one of the controls fails, the other can still provide some level of protection.

### Comparative understanding with previous work

There are prior investigations into the effectiveness of Cyber Essential controls. The corpus of attacks we investigated is smaller than [17]. However, the cases we investigate are detailed incidents that provide an in-depth view of the controls needed to prevent attacks. Our analysis shows that CE controls are effective in preventing most of the attacks in our dataset at the initial stages. However, a comparative understanding of the incident reports between [17] and ours reveals that while Cyber Essential controls are robust against malicious remote access, like establishing command & control channels and remote desktops, they do not mitigate against human factors, especially during attack staging. The impact of the latter is pronounced, as we see in our corpus that includes ransomware incidents. If attacks progress beyond the initial stages there is a more pronounced need for AC, and CE controls by themselves are not enough to protect against them. There is a synergy between the additional socio-technical & technical controls suggested by prior work [17] and our work. Table 4 presents the suggested AC across prior reports and our findings. Logging & monitoring, as a technical control is suggested by the prior studies [17], a control suggested by our investigations as well. Awareness & education is a socio-technical control suggested by the previous reports as well as in our work.

A contrasting case is of patch management between the previous study and ours. We identify patch management as an effective control for 19 of the 45 incidents which is roughly \(42\%\) compared to \(87.5\%\) in the previous study. Firewalls,
