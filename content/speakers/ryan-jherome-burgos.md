I am a Senior Developer with around 7 years of experience, specializing in Angular and React. I started my career in IT consulting and, for the past four years, I have been working in product-based companies.

Throughout my journey, I have developed software across various industries, including healthcare, insurance, banking, and cloud computing.

Beyond development, I am also passionate about teaching. I collaborate with a coding bootcamp, where I train aspiring developers in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Angular.

Additionally, I actively participate in developer communities here in Rome.
