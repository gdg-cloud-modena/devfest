I have been working in the IT industry for over 15 years. I currently hold the role of Senior Enterprise Architect in Adesso. I am a Google Developer Expert on GCP and a Google Cloud Innovator Champion on the topic of modern architecture. I manage GDG Pescara together with other developers, I love sharing my knowledge and trying to do it in a fun way.
