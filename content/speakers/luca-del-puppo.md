I'm a Senior Software Developer, Microsoft MVP, Google Developer Expert Codemotion Ambassador and GitKraken Ambassador. I love JavaScript and TypeScript.

In my free time, I love studying new technologies, improving myself, creating YouTube content or writing technical articles. I canâ€™t stay without trail running and love to do it in my love Dolomiti.
