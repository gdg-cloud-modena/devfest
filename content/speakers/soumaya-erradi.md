I'm an experienced web developer and a passionate IT and electronics trainer, specializing in frontend development and enterprise applications built with Angular.
I spend most of my time exploring what's new in the tech world and helping other developers improve their skills.
As a conference speaker, I bring advanced Angular topics, tips for the integration of smart contracts and best solutions for web3 applications.
