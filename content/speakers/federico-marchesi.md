Hi, my name is Federico Marchesi. During my career, I have had the pleasure to work with a variety of different ML systems, ranging from complex OLAP systems, distributed Machine learning inference platforms, and I have also touched the rise of modern data lakehouses. I'm especially passionate about data, which I believe is the foundation of modern software, not just in ML. Outside of work, I enjoy staying active through MTB, swimming, and running. I'm also a passionate motorsport enthusiast.
