Hi! I’m a frontend developer with a long-standing love affair with JavaScript, CSS, and the magic they bring to the web.
My journey started back in the jQuery era, when Chrome was just a baby—and I’ve been hooked ever since! I thrive on building snappy, interactive experiences and exploring the endless possibilities of the modern web.
