Business Development in the cloud and AI sector, with extensive experience managing strategic partnerships and promoting innovative solutions.

Following a background in telecommunications and an entrepreneurial venture in VoIP, I anticipated market trends by leading projects in Cloud, AI, and Digital Transformation.

As Google Cloud Alliance & Business Development Manager, I support enterprises and public administrations in migrating and optimizing cloud-native solutions, with a strong focus on Data and AI.

A speaker at international events, I was honored with the Google Cloud Partner Sales All-Star 2023 award.
