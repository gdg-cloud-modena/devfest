Professionally grown when the Web was split among Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator and... Macromedia Flash, I've always been passionate about JavaScript, CSS, HTML, web standards and the evolution of the platform. I firmly believes that libraries and frameworks come and go, but only the Web will remain.
Please stop me if I'm talking about CSS for too long.
