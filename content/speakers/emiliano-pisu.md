Hi ðŸ‘‹ Folks!
Iâ€™m Emiliano Pisu, your friendly neighborhood Design Engineer.

Throughout my career, driven by my coding addiction, Iâ€™ve always stayed up to date with software development and related trends, focusing on UI, UX, Accessibility, Responsiveness, Compatibility, Scalability, and Maintainability.

My main goal is to build accessible and pixel-perfect user interfaces that enhance the user experience.

My core approach is to develop with zero dependencies, fostering creativity, learning, experimentation, and deep knowledge. This leads to solutions that not only follow trends but are also carefully tailored to the needs of clients and stakeholders.

I am deeply committed to knowledge sharing and mentorship: through my experience as Sensei @ Dev Dojo IT, I actively support those who want to grow in the frontend world and in designing accessible and scalable interfaces.

In conclusion, Iâ€™m the right person if you need a bridge between Design and Development. I live to simplify my colleagues' DevX, which is why I focus on advocating for the core technologies of the webâ€”strictly vanilla.
