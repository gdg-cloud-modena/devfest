As a Senior Frontend Engineer, I lead two developer communities in Rome: GDG Roma Città and Angular Roma. I am passionate about contributing to the tech community as a writer and speaker.

Specializing in Angular, I also have extensive experience in mobile and desktop app development using Capacitor and Electron. Over the years, I’ve built high-performing applications leveraging technologies like Nx, NgRx, and NGXS.

Outside of work, I love playing board games or practicing archery. I’m also a fan of escape rooms and enjoy creating funny memes.
