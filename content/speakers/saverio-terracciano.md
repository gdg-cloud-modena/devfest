I am a SW Engineer Lead by day and Lead Tech Community organiser by night, co-leading the biggest & most active GDG (Cloud) chapter in the world and speaking at tech events/conferences for AI/ML & Cloud as a Google Developer Expert (GDE).

While I’ve worked for most of my career in C# / .NET, I am always open and eager to learn new languages and technologies, aiming to expand my experience in Cloud and Machine Learning.

Fortuitously receiving a green-on-black Olivetti M19 as a child sparked my love for IT knowledge, that would lead me through the years to obtain a magna cum laude Master’s degree in CS, win several hackathons, work freelance and full time in many different areas (Insurance, Automotive, Robotics research, Marketing) and passionately share it with others through a number of different mediums (Meetups, Conferences, Journal articles, StackOverflow, Medium articles as a writer for the official GCP publication).
