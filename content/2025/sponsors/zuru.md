ZURU Tech is developing cutting-edge architectural design and manufacturing software based on Building Information Modeling (BIM), powering fully automated robotic production plants. By merging advanced digital technologies with construction, we are rethinking how homes are designed, manufactured, and delivered.
Our mission is to disrupt the construction industry and make housing more accessible, sustainable, and efficient. We are creating software that enables users to actively participate in the design of their own homes, giving people the freedom to personalize while solving some of the biggest challenges facing the sector, such as affordability, speed, and waste reduction.
We are a global team united by innovation and expertise. In Modena and Milan, we lead software development and design; in Ahmedabad and Kolkata, we drive online services; in Shenzhen, we focus on manufacturing; while Auckland and Los Angeles host our product design teams. This international collaboration allows us to combine world-leading talent across disciplines, from software engineers and architects to designers and manufacturing experts.
