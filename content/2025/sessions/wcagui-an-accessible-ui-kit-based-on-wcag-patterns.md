Building an accessible web experience shouldn’t be overwhelming. In this talk, we’ll introduce wcagUI, an open-source UI kit that simplifies building accessible interfaces by automatically handling WAI-ARIA attributes and other key accessibility features. Built on the principles of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), wcagUI helps developers and designers integrate accessibility seamlessly into their projects, reducing complexity and allowing a focus on great user experiences.

With a zero-dependencies philosophy and no view encapsulation, wcagUI is lightweight, transparent, and compatible with any tech stack. Developed using modern JavaScript and the customElements API, its reusable components manage accessibility features like WAI-ARIA roles and states automatically. wcagUI also adheres to progressive enhancement principles, ensuring components provide core functionality even when JavaScript is unavailable, making interfaces more resilient and inclusive.

As the European Accessibility Act (EAA) enforces strict accessibility requirements across the EU, tools like wcagUI are more critical than ever. By streamlining compliance and making accessibility effortless, wcagUI not only ensures inclusivity but also helps avoid legal risks and keeps your products competitive. This talk will equip you with the knowledge and tools to create accessible, future-ready projects with confidence.
