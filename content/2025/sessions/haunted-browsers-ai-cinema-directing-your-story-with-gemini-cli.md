In this session, we'll reveal the Gemini CLI as two revolutionary tools in one. First, we'll demo the "Haunted Browser": a web developer's dream. See how the Model Context Protocol (MCP) connects the LLM to Playwright, automating tedious web tasks like clicking buttons, logging in, and navigating sitesâ€”a true "new age curl". 
Then, for something completely different, we'll unveil the "AI Cinema": a creator's studio. Watch as we use the CLI to direct and generate entire, multi-step video storylines from a single prompt. ðŸ¤– 
Two powerful demos, one tool, and we'll show how we can automate in the cloud with GitHub Actions.
