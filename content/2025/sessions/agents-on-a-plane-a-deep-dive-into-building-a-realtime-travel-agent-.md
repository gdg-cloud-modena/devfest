In 2025, an LLM agent needs to do more than just talk. It needs to do. This presentation is a hands-on look at building a truly useful AI travel agent with a multi-agent framework.
Forget abstract concepts; we're diving straight into the code of a live demo that queries real APIs for flights, hotels üè®, and AirB&Bs. We will cover how to structure a multi-agent system to handle complex, real-world tasks: validating budgets, managing user preferences, and visualizing results. You will learn how to implement an advanced, modular system that can be deployed on any cloud with any LLM.
