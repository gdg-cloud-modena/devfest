No slides, just code and generative creativity. This isn't a talk; it's a live experiment. The mission? To go from an audience idea to a deployed app using Gemini, Firebase Studio and Google Cloud. We'll tackle challenges in real-time, showcasing the true power of AI in the end-to-end software development process.
