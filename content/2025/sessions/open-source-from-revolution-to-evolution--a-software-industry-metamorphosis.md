From the ideological battles between Free Software and Open Source, through the rise of developer-driven innovation, to today's complex landscape of cloud services and licensing wars, Open Source has been both a movement and a business model. This talk looks at its past, examines its present challenges, and projects its future evolution.

We will go through its birth and divergence, its "Golden Age" of "Open Source by default", the challenges posed by the Cloud, and the current present situation.

In conclusion, we will try to predict the next decade. What will replace Open Source?
