In the ever-changing landscape of software development, developers often face the challenge of managing their priorities amidst the unpredictable influences of various stakeholders, from Product Owners to corporate executives. This talk delves into the metaphor of a "corporate jungle" to illustrate the dynamic environment developers operate in and emphasizes practical prioritization strategies to navigate these complexities. By understanding the roles of different "corporate animals" like wolves, zebras, and hippos, developers will learn how to stay focused on their tasks, manage disruptions, and maintain productivity.
