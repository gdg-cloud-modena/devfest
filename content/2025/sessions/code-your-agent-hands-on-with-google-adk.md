Ready to move beyond basic chatbots and build truly intelligent, autonomous agents? This hands-on workshop is your entry point to Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK). In just two hours, we'll dive into the code-first, modular framework that's changing how developers build AI applications. You'll not only learn the fundamentals of ADK but also build, test, and run your very own AI agent from scratch.

This isn't a theory-heavy lecture. We'll be in the trenches, writing code, integrating tools, and seeing our agents come to life. By the end of this session, you'll have a working agent that can leverage the power of Google Search, use a custom-built tool, and even interact with your local file system using natural language commands. Get ready to unleash the full potential of agentic AI.

Prerequisites & Requirements:

To ensure a smooth and productive session, please come prepared with the following:

1) Laptop
2) Personal Gmail account: Required to set up a Gemini API Key and to access to other tools
