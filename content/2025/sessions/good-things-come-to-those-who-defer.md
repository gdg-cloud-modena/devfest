Performance and user experience are essential in modern web development — and Angular’s @defer directive is changing the way we think about rendering.
In this talk, we’ll explore the powerful combination of Deferrable Views and Incremental Hydration, introduced in Angular v19, and how they can help you deliver faster, smarter applications.

You’ll learn how to:

- Understand the differences between CSR, SSR, and SSG — and when to use each
- Optimize content loading using @defer and its powerful trigger system
- Use Incremental Hydration to deliver seamless interactivity for SSR apps
- Avoid common pitfalls and follow best practices to improve performance

This session provides practical insights to boost both developer experience and runtime efficiency.
