What if you, as an Android developer, could suddenly develop for iOS without learning a new language or framework? This isn't a fantasy; it's the reality that Compose Multiplatform brings to the table. 

We will see how, thanks to the adoption of Kotlin Multiplatform by Google, it is possibile to actually write an Android app that runs on iOS without knowing almost anything about iOS development. 

The core of this talk will be a demonstration where we take a native Android application, built entirely with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, and methodically migrate it to run on iOS with only a few lines of code changed, proving that you can expand your reach without abandoning the tools you already know and love.
