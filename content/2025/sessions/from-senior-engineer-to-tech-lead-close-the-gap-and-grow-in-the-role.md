In this talk, we’ll look at what it takes to move from being a Senior Engineer to a Tech Lead. We’ll start by exploring the Senior Engineer role, covering what’s expected and which technical and personal skills are needed to do well. Then, we’ll meet Bob, a Senior Engineer who wants to become a Tech Lead but feels like it’s a big leap.

We’ll then talk about what a Tech Lead does, the skills they need, and how they help their team. I’ll share practical ways to start building these skills, including live examples of key soft skills through interactive, scenario-based exercises. I’ll invite audience members to join me in these real-world situations, where we’ll role-play and have a dialogue to show how a Tech Lead responds in different scenarios. Finally, 

At the end, I will provide a detailed step-by-step roadmap to help you move from Senior Engineer to Tech Lead. This talk will leave you with clear steps and motivation to take your career to the next level.
